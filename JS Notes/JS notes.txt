OOPs :- Object-Oriented Programming System

1. what is oops definition?
-> Oops refer to those programming languages that mostly use objects. Oops basically refers real life entities/set up like inheritance,hiding and polymorphism.

2. What is oops importance?
-> Oops helps to bind data and function that oprate on then so other code can not access that data except those function.

3. What is class?
-> A class is like a blueprint for creating objects. Think of it as a template. It defines the properties and methods that an object created from the class will have.
-> A class is a user defined data type that contains data mamber and member function. which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class.

4. What is a constructor?
-> constructor is a special function that creates and initializer an object instance of a class. In JavaScript a constructor gets called when an object is created using the new keyword. The purpose of a constructor is to create a new object and set values for any existing object properties.

5. What is creating objects?
-> An object is an instance of a class you create an object using the (New) keyword.

6. What is this keyword?
-> The this keyword refers to the object that is currently executing the code. In the context of a class, this refers to the instance of the class.

7. What does new do?
-> The new keyword is used to create an instance of a class. When you use new, it does the following :-
   1. Creates a new empty object 
   2. Blinds this to the new object
   3. Sets up the prototype chain
   4. Calls the constructor function to initialize the object.
